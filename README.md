### Hi there 👋

I'm a student at Jagiellonian University, studying Theoretical Computer Science. 
- 🖥️ I have a strong interest in machine learning
- 🦾 I’m skilled in algorithms and data structures
- 🥋 I’ve been training in jiu-jitsu since I was seven
- 📖 I’m a fan of Brandon Sanderson’s books
- 🧶 I enjoy crocheting

I found the GIF here: https://medium.com/@p._./neural-nets-299072b6e45f

Later, I've edited it in GIMP (I'm too poor for Photoshop).

# My projects:

## [Continual Learning with KNN](https://github.com/Hubizon/continual-learning-knn)
This is my most recent project, where the goal is to outperform [FeCAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14062) as a new method of continual learning (though it remains to be seen if we'll succeed). I am working on this with my tutor, and regardless of the results, we aim to conduct a deep analysis of the topic and write a paper on our findings.

## [Cpp Tensor](https://github.com/Hubizon/cpp-tensor)
In this project, I sought to deepen my understanding of gradient descent by implementing it from scratch in C++.

## [Notes]()
In high school, I focused on studying algorithms for the Olympiad in Informatics, and [here](https://github.com/Hubizon/cpp-algorithms) are some of my C++ algorithm implementations (most of which I knew by heart). I also began exploring machine learning, and these [notes](https://github.com/Hubizon/ml-notes) were part of my preparation for the Olympiad in Artificial Intelligence.

## [Life on Steroids](https://github.com/Hubizon/game-of-life)
One of my first projects, developed in primary school with help from my brother (who assisted with GitHub and publishing it on Google Play), is a simple life simulator where you can search for a job, get married, or even pursue a life of crime. Regardless of the path you choose, you must always remember to eat and stay well-rested!
